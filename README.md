## Status

**`Work In progress`**

## About
<!-- DESCRIPTION START -->

This is an evaluation board for TI's LP5868TMRKPR using a discrete 6x8 RGB LED matrix over it's SPI interface.

<!-- DESCRIPTION END -->

This board is meant to be used with the [2040Macro](https://github.com/LeHuman/2040Macro).

### Note

As this is simply an experimental prototype, the board has not been tested, nor has it been designed, to be assembled with any commercial processes. The PCB, however, targets JLCPCB's 6 Layer special price of ~$5. This has affected design choices.

### Why

This project serves as a shield-like proof of concept for the [2040Macro](https://github.com/LeHuman/2040Macro).
